_This is the sandbox for a new, centralized Code4Sac website_
This site needs content, styling, and more! More details on how to help are coming soon.

### Everyone can pitch in to help get our new website ready!

For a list of things we need help on, please check out the [issues page](https://github.com/code4sac/code4sac.github.io/issues?state=open).


#For Developers:

### Running Locally

code4sac.github.io is run on GitHub pages, and uses [Jekyll][jekyll].

##### Pre-requisites

1. [Ruby][ruby]
2. [Bundler][bundler]

Once you have satisfied the pre-requisites, install the Ruby Gem dependencies:

    bundle install

This will install Jekyll which is used to compile the site.

Now fire up Jekyll:

    jekyll serve --watch

This will start up a web server at `http://localhost:4000` that will serve the site content on your computer.

Whenever you make a change, Jekyll will automatically re-compile the site's content and it will instantly be available in your local copy for you to play with.

That's it!
