_This is the sandbox for a new, centralized Code4Sac website_
This site needs content, styling, and more! More details on how to help are coming soon.

**Current priority:** This website needs to help people get involved in Code4Sac projects. 

###How to contribute an idea or update for a Code4Sac project:

All projects and project ideas, regardless of who or what's involved, need a page on the new Code4Sac website! 

1. Try adding your idea/project to this google doc here: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P74Fi6_Rr-3fUOigscbcd4z9_K9yS3BRTazr4FfETeg/edit#] and feel free to copy/paste until we get a better tool!

2. If you have an idea for a new cause we could support, add it to the google doc!

3. If you have an idea for a new project, add it to the google doc! 

4. Coders will add the projects and causes to the new C4S website.

#For Developers:

### Running Locally

code4sac.github.io is run on GitHub pages, and uses [Jekyll][jekyll].

##### Pre-requisites

1. [Ruby][ruby]
2. [Bundler][bundler]

Once you have satisfied the pre-requisites, install the Ruby Gem dependencies:

    bundle install

This will install Jekyll which is used to compile the site.

Now fire up Jekyll:

    jekyll serve --watch

This will start up a web server at `http://localhost:4000` that will serve the site content on your computer.

Whenever you make a change, Jekyll will automatically re-compile the site's content and it will instantly be available in your local copy for you to play with.

That's it!
