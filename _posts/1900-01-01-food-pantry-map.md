<!-- Add project description text here! -->

The vision: Dr. Goore wants to bring community organizations together to address food insecurity in Sacramento. The first project: Dr. Goore loves this website -- http://www.wastenotoc.org/ and wants to explore how we might recreate something like this (and especially the map of the food pantries) for Sac!
