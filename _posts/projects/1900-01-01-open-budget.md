<!-- Add project description text here! -->

When governments publish their budgets in a computer-friendly format, spending information becomes much more accessible for analysis by the public. Currently, the City of Sacramento publishes its budget in PDF format, which creates barriers for analysts. Fortunately, the City is currently working to publish its budget data on its data portal. In the meantime, Code4Sac data guru Jay Venti has employed advanced techniques to convert the City's current budget publications to open, machine-readable information. Go Jay!!!
