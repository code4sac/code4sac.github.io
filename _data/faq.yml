- question: "I'm not a coder. What can I do?"
  answer: "At Code4Sac, writing software is our approach to helping make government easier for people to use, but it isn't the whole story. It takes analysts, marketers, visionaries and storytellers to turn a bit of software into a useful tool that empowers our community."

- question: "I donâ€™t have a lot of time. How can I help?"
  answer: "We meet in person every week, but we also collaborate online. Contact one of our project leads to see how you can become a digital volunteer!"

- question: "How would I benefit from being a Code4Sac volunteer?"
  answer: "Apart from free pizza on Wednesdays? Working with us is a great way to get your ideas heard, strengthen your skills, and connect with community leaders."

- question: "I work for city/county/state/federal government. That won't be a conflict of interest, will it?"
  answer: "Many of our volunteers are public sector employees. There are many wonderful ways you can contribute as a private citizen without crossing into areas that relate to your professional work."

- question: "What should I expect at a hack night?"
  answer: "People usually start showing up at 6:00 pm. We start the evening formally at 6:30 pm, when we pitch new ideas and hear current project updates. At 7:00 pm we break into informal groups to work on projects of our choice. Did we mention the free pizza??!"
