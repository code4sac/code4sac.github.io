<!-- Add project description text here! -->

As part of their upper-division coursework, a team of students from Sac State will build a mobile app prototype to help local Sacramentans find community services, with scalability in mind. Community Link Capitol Region -- experts in local resource data -- has agreed to advise on an ad hoc basis and maybe more as the project grows! The applicationâ€™s source code will be published publically by Code4Sac on GitHub upon completion.
