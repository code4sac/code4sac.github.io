<!--
idea from David... use the iconic Sacramento bridge as a metaphor... bridge
image in the background... and it would be cool if we could position it such

We are a [Code for America Brigade](http://www.codeforamerica.org) -- local
volunteers who study community problems, build civic apps and make government
more open for everyone.
