	<h2>About us</h2>
	<p>Code4Sac is a <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org">Code for America</a> brigade. We are local volunteers who study community problems, build civic apps, and make government more open for everyone.</p>

	<h4>Strategic outcomes</h4>
		<p>The purpose of Brigade is to create and sustain local instances of these four shared goals and strategic outcomes:</p>
		<ul>Governments leveraging technology more effectively</ul>
		<ul>Citizens and community groups solving civic issues</ul>
		<ul>Cities collaborating to work better</ul>
		<ul>Civic apps built on linked, open data</ul>
	
	<h4>Our approach</h4>
		<p>In pursuit of our goals, we do things like:</p>
		<ul>Work on projects</ul>
		<ul>Teach and learn from each other</ul>
		<ul>Reach out to local government staff and community organizations</ul>
		<ul>Welcome anyone and everyone to our group -- no coding skills required!</ul>
